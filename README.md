# Cloudstate Sample Shopping Cart Application

The following assumes that you have completed the steps for setting up your local environment as well as creating an account and project.  If you have not done this you must follow the instructions here:

* [Setting Up your Machine](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/setup.html)
   * as well as the [Developer prerequisites](https://docs.lbcs.dev/developing/developing.html#prerequisites)
   * Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (node package manager)
      * We recommend v6.14.3 or later.  (Check with `npm -v`)
   * You also need to install the protobuf compiler.
      * We recommend using v3.0.0 or later.  (Check with `protoc --version`)
      * Mac OS X `brew install protobuf`
      * linux `sudo apt install protobuf-compiler`
      * Or [alternatively](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads) (src and bins)
* [Your Lightbend Cloudstate Account](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/account.html)
* [Creating a Project](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/project.html)

## Sample application layout

The sample application consists of 2 services:
* A stateless service `frontend`
* A stateful Entity based service `js-shopping-cart`

Additionally:
* A `cloudstate` directory that contains proto definitions needed.
* A `deploy` directory that contains the deployment yaml files.

### Quick Install

All the latest docker images are available publicly at `lightbend-docker-registry.bintray.io/cloudstate-samples`.

To deploy the shopping-cart application as is, connect to your kubernetes environment and do the following.

```bash
cd deploy
kubectl apply -f . -n <project-name>

# To Verify
kubectl -n <project-name>  get statefulservices
NAME            AGE    REPLICAS   STATUS
shopping-cart   5m     1          Running
```


## Building and deploying the Sample application

### Frontend Service
The frontend service is a front end web application written in typescript.  It is backed by a `stateless` service that will serve the compiled javacript, html and images.

This service makes `grpc-web` calls directly to the other services to get the data that it needs.  In order to do this we need to compile the proto definitions from the other services as well as generate the grpc-web clients.  This is all done with a shell script `protogen.sh`.  Let's first run the protogen script, then compile the service definition and finally compile our typescript.

```
cd frontend
npm install
```
This will install your dependencies, including cloudstate javascript client library.
```
./protogen.sh
```
protogen shell script will collect the required proto files and generate `grpc-web` clients for both typescript and javascript.  
These files will appear under the `src/_proto` directory
```
npm run prestart
```
The prestart script will run the `compile-descriptor` located in the cloudstate client library using your 
service definition `shop.proto` outputting `user-function.desc`.  
```
npm run-script build
```
Finally the build script will compile the typescript and javascript into a webpack bundle.js file.  This contains the code 
for your web front end.

Build a docker image with the right registry and tag

NOTE: you can get a free public docker registry by signing up at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/)
```
docker build . -t <my-registry>/frontend:latest
```

Push the docker image to the registry

```
docker push <my-registry>/frontend:latest
```

Deploy the image by changing into the deploy folder and editing the `frontend.yaml` to point to your docker image that you just pushed.
```
$ cd ../deploy
$ cat frontend.yaml
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: StatefulService
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - image: lightbend-docker-registry.bintray.io/cloudstate-samples/shopping-cart:latest # <-- Change this to your repo/image
    name: frontend
```

Deploy the service to your project namespace
```
kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml -n <project_name>
statefulservice.cloudstate.io/frontend created
````


### Stateful Store

The shopping cart stateful service relies on a stateful store as defined in `shopping-store.yaml`.

Deploy the store to your project namespace
```
$ kubectl apply -f shopping-store.yaml -n <project-name>
statefulstore.cloudstate.io/shopping-store created
````

### Shopping Cart Service
```
cd ../js-shopping-cart
npm install
npm run prestart
```
For this service there is no web front end, so we only need to compile the `shoppingcart.proto` into the `user-function.desc`.

Build a docker image with the right registry and tag

NOTE: you can get a free public docker registry by signing up at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/)
```
docker build . -t <my-registry>/shopping-cart:latest
```

Push the docker image to the registry
```
docker push <my-registry>/shopping-cart:latest
```

Deploy the image by changing into the deploy folder and editing `js-shopping-cart.yaml` to point to the docker image that you just pushed.
```
$ cd ../deploy
$ cat js-shopping-cart.yaml
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: StatefulService
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart
spec:
  # Datastore configuration
  storeConfig:
    database: shopping
    statefulStore:
      # Name of a deployed Datastore to use.
      name: shopping-store
  containers:
    - image:  lightbend-docker-registry.bintray.io/cloudstate-samples/frontend:latest # <-- Change this to your repo/image
      name: js-shopping-cart
```

Deploy the service to your project namespace
```
$ kubectl apply -f js-shopping-cart.yaml -n <project-name>
statefulservice.cloudstate.io/shopping-cart created
````

### Verify they are running
Check that the services are running
```
$ kubectl get statefulservices -n <project-name>
NAME            AGE    REPLICAS   STATUS
shopping-cart   6m     1          Running
frontend        3m     1          Running
```

To redeploy a new image to the cluster you must delete and then redeploy using the yaml file.  
For example if we updated the shopping-cart docker image we would do the following.
````
$ kubectl delete statefulservice shopping-cart -n <project-name>
statefulservice.cloudstate.io "shopping-cart" deleted
$ kubectl apply -f js-shopping-cart.yaml -n <project-name>    
statefulservice.cloudstate.io/shopping-cart created
````

## Routes
The last thing that is required is to provide the public routes needed for both the front end and grpc-web calls.  These exist in the `routes.yaml` file.

```
$ cat routes.yaml
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: "shopping-routes"
spec:
  http:
  - name: "shopping-routes"
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/com.example.shoppingcart.ShoppingCart/"
    route:
      service: shopping-cart
  - name: "frontend-routes"
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/"
    route:
      service: frontend     
```

Add these routes by performing
```
kubectl apply -f routes.yaml -n <project-name>
```

Open a web browser and navigate to:

`https://<project-name>.us-east1.apps.lbcs.dev/pages/index.html`

You should now see the shopping cart interface.

## Quick Install

All the latest docker images are available publicly at `lightbend-docker-registry.bintray.io/`.

To deploy the shopping cart application as is, connect to your kubernetes environment and do the following.

### Deployment
```bash
$ cd deploy
$ kubectl apply -f . -n <project-name>
# verify stateful store
$ kubectl get -n <project-name> statefulstore
NAME                  AGE
shopping-store   21m
# verify stateful services
$ kubectl -n <project-name>  get statefulservices
NAME            AGE    REPLICAS   STATUS
shopping-cart   7m     1          Running
frontend        4m     1          Running
```

To access the front end chat interface open a web browser and navigate to:

`https://<project-name>.us-east1.apps.lbcs.dev/pages/index.html`
